# Nova-Account-Creator
Nova Account Creator is a 3rd party tool that creates a account when already having one!

# How to install
**IMPORTANT!**
Anti Virus must be off for it to work! Otherwise, it won't work!

1. When you download it in releases, youll see a couple of files, the one we are focusing on is the BAT file.
2. Open the Nova Account Creator.bat and press any key, then type what it says.
3. If it stays stuck at Spoof or AntiBan, manually open the other 2 programs and close the CMD after.
4. If logging in doesnt work, try again tommorow as it will IP Ban you.

# Video Proof
Incase you think its a virus, here is proof its not.
